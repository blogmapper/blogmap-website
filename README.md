## blogmap-website

This is the repository for blogmapapp.com. 

## Usage

The site uses private API's from MapBox and for the data featured on the map. These have been removed from the repository, but you can modify the code to use your own MapBox access tokens and map styles. The data is loaded in geojson format and you can modify the code to either use local json files or data from a third-party API.
